# Create a sharded cluster instance

This topic describes how to create a sharded cluster instance in the ApsaraDB for MongoDB console.

-   An Alibaba Cloud account is registered. For more information, see [Sign up with Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/50482.htm).
-   Your account balance is sufficient if you want to create a pay-as-you-go instance.

## Billing

For more information, see [Billing items and pricing](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Billing items and pricing.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB for MongoDB console](https://mongodb.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the resource group and the region of the target instance.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Sharded Cluster Instances**.

4.  On the **Sharded Cluster Instances** page, click **Create Instance**.

5.  Click **Subscription\(Sharding\)** or **Pay-As-You-Go\(Sharding\)**.

    **Note:**

    -   Subscription: You must pay the subscription fee when you create an instance. We recommend that you select this billing method for long-term use, because it is more cost-effective than pay-as-you-go billing. Longer subscription periods have larger discounts.
    -   Pay-as-you-go: A pay-as-you-go instance is charged at an hourly rate based on your actual resource usage. We recommend that you select this billing method for short-term use. You can reduce costs by releasing your pay-as-you-go instance after you no longer need it.
6.  Configure the instance parameters. The following table describes related parameters.

    |Section|Parameter|Description|
    |:------|:--------|:----------|
    |**Basic Configuration**|**Region**|The region where the sharded cluster instance is deployed. After an instance is created, you cannot change its region. Exercise caution when you select the region.

Only instances in the same region \(for example, an [ECS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/25367.htm) and an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance\) can be interconnected with each other over the internal network. |
    |**Zone**|A [zone](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/40654.htm#h2-url-2) is a geographic area with an independent power supply and network. An ECS instance and an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance in the same zone can be interconnected over the internal network with the minimum network latency.

**Note:** To implement zone-disaster recovery, you can deploy the replica set instance across multiple zones. For more information, see [Create a multi-zone sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Zone-disaster restoration solution/Create a multi-zone sharded cluster instance.md). |
    |**Database Version**|The version of the database engine for the sharded cluster instance. ApsaraDB for MongoDB supports 3.2, 3.4, 4.0, and 4.2.

For more information about versions, see [MongoDB versions and storage engines](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/MongoDB versions and storage engines.md).

**Note:** You can manually upgrade the database version while an instance is running. For more information, see [Upgrade the database version](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Upgrading Database Version/Upgrade the database version of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md). |
    |**Storage Engine**|The storage engine is **WiredTiger**. |
    |**Network Type**|**Classic**|Cloud services in the classic network are not isolated. You can configure security groups or whitelist policies to block unauthorized access to the cloud services.|
    |**VPC**|A VPC is an isolated network with higher security and performance than the classic network. We recommend that you select the VPC network type. **Note:**

    -   You must create a VPC in advance. For more information, see [Create a VPC](/intl.en-US/VPCs and VSwitches/VPC management/Create a VPC.md).
    -   You can change the network type after you create an instance. For more information, see [Modify the instance network type](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Network connection management/Switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).
    -   If you want to migrate your applications to the cloud, you can build a virtual data center by connecting your on-premises data center to the resources in a VPC through a leased line or a virtual private network \(VPN\). For more information, see [Configure a hybrid access solution to switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance from Classic Network to VPC](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Network connection management/Configure a hybrid access solution to switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance from Classic Network to VPC.md). |
    |**Mongos Specification**|**Specification**|The specifications of each mongos. For more information, see [Instance specifications](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance types.md). **Note:** You can add new mongos or change the configurations of existing mongos while a sharded cluster instance is running. |
    |**Quantity**|The number of mongos.

A sharded cluster instance can contain 2 to 32 mongos. |
    |**Shard Specifications**|**Specification**|The specifications of each shard. For more information, see [Instance types](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance types.md). **Note:** You can add new shards or change the configurations of existing shards while a sharded cluster instance is running. |
    |**Storage Space**|The storage space of each shard. Valid values: 10 GB to 1,000 GB. **Note:** The storage space of a shard stores your data, system, and log files. |
    |**Quantity**|The number of shards.

A sharded cluster instance can contain 2 to 32 shards. |
    |**Configserver Specifications**|**Specification**|The specifications of each config server: 1 core, 2 GB of memory, and 20 GB of storage space. The config server specifications are not user-configurable. |
    |**Set Password**|**Set Now**|    -   The password must contain at least three of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Special characters include

! \#$%^&\*\(\)\_+-=

    -   The password must be 8 to 32 characters in length. |
    |**Set Later**|[Set a password for a sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start for Cluster/Set a password for a sharded cluster instance.md) after the instance is created.|
    |**Validity**|N/A|You must specify this parameter when you create a sharded cluster instance that uses the subscription billing method. You can select one to nine months for a monthly subscription or one to three years for an annual subscription.|

7.  After you configure the preceding parameters, click **Buy Now**.

8.  On the Confirm Order page, read and select ApsaraDB for MongoDB Agreement of Service, and complete the payment.


## View the created instance

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB for MongoDB console](https://mongodb.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the resource group and the region of the target instance.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Sharded Cluster Instances**.


## Troubleshoot if you cannot find the instance

|Possible causes|Solution|
|---------------|--------|
|You selected the wrong region in the console.|Select the region where the instance is deployed. For more information, see [View the created instance](#section_w0s_59q_9fp).|
|You opened the incorrect page.|In the left-side navigation pane, click **Sharded Cluster Instances**. For more information, see [View the created instance](#section_w0s_59q_9fp).|
|The instance list in the ApsaraDB for MongoDB console was not updated or was updated before the instance was created.|Wait for several minutes and then update the instance list to check whether the instance is added to the list.|
|Resources are insufficient.|The system may fail to create the instance due to insufficient resources. In this case, your payment is refunded. You can check the refund on the [Orders](https://expense.console.aliyun.com/#/order/list/) page.

After you confirm the refunded fees, you can try to create the instance in another zone. You can also [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm#/ticket/createIndex). |

After you create an instance, you must configure a whitelist. For more information, see [Configure a whitelist for a sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start for Cluster/Configure a whitelist for a sharded cluster instance.md). If you want to connect to the instance over the Internet, you must apply for a public endpoint. For more information, see [Apply for a public endpoint for a sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start for Cluster/Apply for a public endpoint for a sharded cluster instance.md).
