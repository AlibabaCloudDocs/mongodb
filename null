# Apply for a public endpoint for a standalone ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance

This topic describes how to apply for a public endpoint for a standalone ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance when you want to connect to this instance over the Internet.

The following table describes the connections supported by a standalone ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

|Address type|Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
|VPC connection address|-   A VPC is an isolated virtual network with better security and performance than a classic network.
-   By default, an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance provides VPC connection addresses. |
|Public connection address|-   By default, ApsaraDB for MongoDB instances do not provide public connection addresses because connecting to instances over the Internet poses security risks.
-   If you want to connect to an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance from a device outside of Alibaba Cloud \(such as a local device\), you must apply for a public endpoint. |

## Procedure

**Note:** To ensure data security, promptly release public connection addresses you no longer need. For more information, see [Release a public connection address](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Network connection management/Public IP Connection/Release a public endpoint.md).

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB for MongoDB console](https://mongodb.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the resource group and the region of the target instance.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Replica Set Instances**.

4.  Find the target instance and click its ID.

5.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Database Connections**.
