# Get started

This topic describes how to get started with a replica set instance of ApsaraDB for MongoDB. In this topic, you can quickly become familiar with the operations for creating, configuring, and connecting to an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

## Flowchart for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance

The first time you use ApsaraDB for MongoDB, you can start with [Before you start](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Usage notes.md).

The following figure shows the operations that you must perform before you use an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.
