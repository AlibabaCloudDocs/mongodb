# Set the monitoring granularity

ApsaraDB for MongoDB allows you to set the monitoring granularity to 1 second or 300 seconds, that is, collecting monitoring data once every second or 300 seconds, based on your business needs.

## Prerequisites

-   A replica set or sharded cluster instance is used.
-   The database version of the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance is MongoDB 3.4, 4.0, or 4.2. If the database version is earlier than MongoDB 3.4, you can upgrade the database version. For more information, see [Upgrade MongoDB versions](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Upgrading Database Version/Upgrade the database version of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).

## Billing

Currently, ApsaraDB for MongoDB allows you to collect monitoring data at the finest granularity of 1 second free of charge.

## Important notes

The 1 second monitoring granularity is only available in the latest minor version of ApsaraDB for MongoDB version 3.4. The latest minor version of version 3.4 is compatible with all earlier minor versions.

-   An ApsaraDB for MongoDB 3.4 instance created before December 5, 2017 will be automatically upgraded to the latest minor version of version 3.4 available if you have restarted the instance after the specified date. We recommend that you restart your instances during off-peak periods. The monitoring granularity will take effect for all metrics after restart.
-   You can set the monitoring granularity to 1 second for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB 3.4 instance created after December 5, 2017. The monitoring granularity takes effect for all metrics immediately.
