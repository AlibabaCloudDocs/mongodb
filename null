# Connect to a sharded cluster ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance by using the mongo shell

This topic describes how to connect to a sharded cluster instance by using the mongo shell. The mongo shell is a database management tool that comes with MongoDB. You can install the mongo shell on your client or in an ECS instance.

-   The version of the mongo shell is the same as your instance. This ensures successful authentication. For more information about the installation procedure, visit [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Select the correct version based on your client.
-   The IP address of your client is added to a whitelist of the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance. For more information, see [Configure a whitelist for a standalone ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance]().

    **Note:** If you want to connect to the instance over the Internet, you must apply for a public endpoint. For more information, see [Apply for a public endpoint for a sharded cluster instance]().


## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB for MongoDB console](https://mongodb.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the resource group and the region of the target instance.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Sharded Cluster Instances**.

4.  Find the target instance and click its ID.

5.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Database Connections** to obtain the endpoint of a mongos.

6.  Connect to the sharded cluster instance from your client or ECS instance that has the mongo shell installed.

    ```
    mongo --host <mongos_host> -u <username> -p --authenticationDatabase <database>
    ```

    **Note:**

    -   <mongos\_host\>: the endpoint of a mongos in the sharded cluster instance.
    -   <username\>: the database account of the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance. The initial account is root. We recommend that you do not log on to a database as the root account in a production environment. You can create accounts and grant permissions to the accounts. For more information, see [Manage user permissions on MongoDB databases](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Account management/Manage user permissions on MongoDB databases.md).
    -   <database\>: the name of the authentication database to which the database account belongs. If the database account is root, enter admin. If you want to specify a database other than the authentication database, run the [db.createUser\(\)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/index.html) command to create an account and then use the account to connect to the database.
    Example:

    ```
    mongo --host s-bp**********.mongodb.rds.aliyuncs.com:3717 -u root -p --authenticationDatabase admin
    ```

7.  When `Enter password:` is displayed, enter the password of the database account and press Enter. If you forget the password of the root account, you can reset the password. For more information, see [Set a password for a standalone ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance]().

    **Note:** The password you enter is not displayed.
