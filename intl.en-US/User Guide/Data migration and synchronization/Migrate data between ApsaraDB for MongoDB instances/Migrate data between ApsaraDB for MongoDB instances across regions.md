# Migrate data between ApsaraDB for MongoDB instances across regions

This topic describes how to migrate a standalone instance or a replica set instance across regions by using Data Transmission Service \(DTS\). DTS allows you to migrate full data and incremental data without service disruptions.

-   The source instance is a standalone instance or a replica set instance. If the source instance is a sharded cluster instance, we recommend that you use the built-in tools of MongoDB to migrate data. For more information, see [Migrate a self-managed MongoDB database to ApsaraDB for MongoDB by using tools provided by MongoDB](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Migrate data/Migrate a self-managed MongoDB database to ApsaraDB for MongoDB by using tools provided
         by MongoDB.md).

    **Note:** You cannot use DTS to migrate incremental data of a standalone instance. For more information, see [Migration types](#section_iml_stz_6ef).

-   The destination instance is created in the destination region. For more information, see [Create a standalone instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create an instance/Create a standalone instance.md), [Create a replica set instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create an instance/Create a replica set instance.md), or [Create a sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create an instance/Create a sharded cluster instance.md).

    **Note:** The available storage space of the destination instance must be larger than the occupied storage space of the source instance.

You may need to migrate data between ApsaraDB for MongoDB instances across regions in the following scenarios:

-   Change a business structure.
-   Use an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance to provide database services for applications deployed on an ECS instance. However, the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance and the ECS instance are not in the same region.

An ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance in the China \(Qingdao\) region is migrated to an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance in the China \(Hangzhou\) region in this example.

**Note:** This example describes only how to migrate data from the source instance. After data is migrated, you can release the source instance if you no longer need the source instance.

## Precautions

-   DTS uses resources of the source and destination instances during full data migration. This may increase the load of the database server. If the data volume is large or the specification is low, the database server may become unavailable. We recommend that you migrate data during off-peak hours.
-   To ensure data consistency, we recommend that you do not write data to the source instance while full data migration of a standalone instance is in progress.
-   If the source and destination instances run different database versions or storage engines, make sure that the instances do not have compatibility issues between them before you start the migration. For more information about the database versions and storage engines supported by ApsaraDB for MongoDB, see [MongoDB versions and storage engines](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/MongoDB versions and storage engines.md).
-   To ensure better performance and stability of the instance, the system will upgrade the minor version to the latest version by default. If the minor version of your instance expires or is not included in the maintenance list and the instance is [upgraded](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Upgrading Database Version/Upgrade MongoDB versions.md), [migrated](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Data migration and synchronization/Overview.md), [changed](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Changing Instance Configuration/Configuration change overview.md), [Created from a backup](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Data recovery/Create an instance from a backup.md), [Created by point-in-time](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Data recovery/Restore data to a new ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance by point in time.md), or performed [Restore data to a new ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Data recovery/Restore data to a new ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).

This ensures that DTS servers can connect to the source and destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instances. After data migration is complete, you can remove the CIDR blocks of DTS servers from the whitelists. For more information, see [Configure a whitelist for a sharded cluster instance]().

7.  Select the migration types and objects to be migrated.

    ![Select the migration types and objects to be migrated](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8435298951/p33662.png)

    |Parameter|Description|
    |:--------|:----------|
    |Migration Types|    -   If you want to migrate all data, select **Full Data Migration**.
    -   If you want to migrate data without interruptions to your business, select both **Full Data Migration** and **Incremental Data Migration**.
**Note:**

    -   DTS does not support **incremental data migration** for standalone instances.
    -   If **Incremental Data Migration** is not selected, do not write data into the source database during full data migration. This ensures data consistency between the source and destination databases. |
    |Available|    -   In the **Available** section, select the objects you want to migrate and then click the ![](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p37966.png) icon to move them to the **Selected** section.

**Note:** Data in the admin and local databases cannot be migrated.

    -   A migration object can be a database, collection, or function.
    -   By default, the name of an object remains unchanged after migration. If you want a different object name after migration, use the object name mapping feature provided by DTS. For more information, see[Object name mapping](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/26628.htm). |

8.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Precheck**.

    **Note:**

    -   Before you can start the data migration task, a precheck is performed. You can start the data migration task only after the task passes the precheck.
    -   If the task fails to pass the precheck, click the ![Info icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p50068.png) icon next to each failed item to view details. Troubleshoot the issues based on the causes and run the precheck again.
9.  After the task passes the precheck, click **Next**.

10. In the **Confirm Settings** dialog box, specify the **Channel Specification** and select **Data Transmission Service \(Pay-As-You-Go\) Service Terms**.

11. Click **Buy and Start** to start the migration task.

    -   Full data migration

        We recommend that you do not manually stop a migration task. Otherwise, data migrated to the destination database will be incomplete. Wait until the migration task automatically stops.

    -   Incremental data migration

        An incremental data migration task does not automatically stop. You must manually stop the migration task.

        **Note:** Select an appropriate time to manually stop the migration task. For example, you can stop the migration task during off-peak hours or before you switch your workloads to the destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

        1.  Wait until **Incremental Data Migration** and **The migration task is not delayed** appear in the progress bar of the migration task. Then, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes. The delay time of **incremental data migration** may be displayed in the progress bar.
        2.  After the status of **incremental data migration** changes to **The migration task is not delayed**, manually stop the migration task.

            ![Incremental data migration without delay](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p33674.png)


## What to do next

Determine whether to release the source instance.

-   If the source instance uses the pay-as-you-go billing method, release the source instance. For more information, see [Release an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Release an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).
-   If the source instance uses the subscription billing method, you cannot release the source instance.
