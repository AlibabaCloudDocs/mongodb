# Overview

This topic provides an overview of the solutions to migrate and synchronize data to or from an ApsaraDB for MongoDB database in different scenarios.

## Data migration solutions

By using [Data Transmission Service \(DTS\)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/26592.htm), you can fully or incrementally migrate the data of a MongoDB database. This can achieve smooth data migration from a MongoDB database to the cloud without affecting businesses.

ApsaraDB for MongoDB supports full data migration by using the official mongodump and mongorestore tools.

In addition, ApsaraDB for MongoDB allows you to migrate data from the Cloud to an on-premises database by using a physical or logical backup file.

## Data synchronization solutions

You can use the MongoShake tool developed by Alibaba Cloud to synchronize data between MongoDB databases.
