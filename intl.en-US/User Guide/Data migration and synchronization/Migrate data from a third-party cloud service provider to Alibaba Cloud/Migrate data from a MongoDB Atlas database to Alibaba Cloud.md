# Migrate data from a MongoDB Atlas database to Alibaba Cloud

This topic describes how to migrate incremental data from a MongoDB Atlas database to Alibaba Cloud by using Data Transmission Service \(DTS\). DTS supports full data migration and incremental data migration. When you migrate data from a MongoDB Atlas database, you can select both migration types to ensure service continuity.

The available storage space of the destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance is larger than the total size of the data in the MongoDB Atlas database.

## Precautions

-   During full data migration, DTS uses read and write resources of the source and destination databases. This may increase the load of the database server. If you migrate a large volume of data or the server specifications cannot meet your requirements, database services may become unavailable. Before you migrate data, evaluate the impact of data migration on the performance of the source and destination databases. We recommend that you migrate data during off-peak hours.
-   You cannot migrate data from the admin or local database.
-   The config database is an internal database. We recommend that you do not migrate this database.
-   If the source MongoDB Atlas database and the destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance have different versions or storage engines, make sure that the versions or storage engines are compatible. For more information, see [MongoDB versions and storage engines](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/MongoDB versions and storage engines.md).

## Billing

|Migration type|Instance configuration|Internet traffic|
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
|Full data migration|Free of charge.|Charged only when data is migrated from Alibaba Cloud over the Internet. For more information, see [Pricing]().|
|Incremental data migration|Charged. For more information, see [Pricing]().|

## Migration types

|Migration type|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Full data migration|DTS migrates all historical data of the required objects from the source MongoDB database to the destination MongoDB database. **Note:** The following types of objects are supported: database, collection, and index. |
|Incremental data migration|After full data migration is complete, DTS synchronizes incremental data from the source MongoDB database to the destination MongoDB database. **Note:**

-   The create and delete operations that are performed on databases, collections, and indexes can be synchronized.
-   The create, delete, and update operations that are performed on documents can be synchronized. |

## Permissions required for database accounts

|Database|Full data migration|Incremental data migration|
|:-------|:------------------|--------------------------|
|MongoDB Atlas database|The read permission on the source database and the permission to perform the listDatabases operation|-   The read permission on the source database, admin database, and local database
-   The permission to perform the listDatabases operation |
|ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance|The read/write permissions on the destination database|The read/write permissions on the destination database|

7.  Select the migration types and objects to be migrated.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Migration Types|    -   To perform only full data migration, select only **Full Data Migration**.

**Note:** If you select only **Full Data Migration**, do not write data to the MongoDB Atlas database during data migration. This ensures data consistency between the source and destination databases.

    -   To ensure service continuity during data migration, select both **Full Data Migration** and **Incremental Data Migration**. |
    |Objects|    -   Select objects from the **Available** section and click the ![Right arrow](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p37966.png) icon to move the objects to the **Selected** section.

**Note:** You cannot migrate data from the admin or local database.

    -   You can select databases, collections, or functions as the objects to be migrated.
    -   After an object is migrated to the destination database, the name of the object remains unchanged. You can change the names of the objects that are migrated to the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance by using the object name mapping feature. For more information about how to use this feature, see [Object name mapping](~~26628~~). |

8.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Precheck**.

    **Note:**

    -   Before you can start the data migration task, a precheck is performed. You can start the data migration task only after the task passes the precheck.
    -   If the task fails to pass the precheck, click the ![Info icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p50068.png) icon next to each failed item to view details. Troubleshoot the issues based on the causes and run the precheck again.
9.  After the task passes the precheck, click **Next**.

10. In the **Confirm Settings** dialog box, specify the **Channel Specification** parameter and select **Data Transmission Service \(Pay-As-You-Go\) Service Terms**.

11. Click **Buy and Start** to start the migration task.

    -   Full data migration

        We recommend that you do not manually stop a data migration task. Otherwise, data migrated to the destination database will be incomplete. Wait until the data migration task automatically stops.

    -   Incremental data migration

        An incremental data migration task does not automatically stop. You must manually stop the migration task.

        **Note:** Select an appropriate time to manually stop the migration task. For example, you can stop the migration task during off-peak hours or before you switch your workloads to the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

        1.  Wait until **Incremental Data Migration** and **The migration task is not delayed** appear in the progress bar of the migration task. Then, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes. The delay time of **incremental data migration** may be displayed in the progress bar.
        2.  After the status of **incremental data migration** changes to **The migration task is not delayed**, manually stop the migration task.
