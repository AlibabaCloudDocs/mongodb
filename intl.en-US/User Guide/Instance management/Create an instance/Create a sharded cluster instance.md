# Create a sharded cluster instance

This topic describes how to create a sharded cluster instance in the ApsaraDB for MongoDB console.

-   An Alibaba Cloud account is created. For more information, see [Sign up with Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/50482.htm).
-   Your account balance is sufficient if you want to create a pay-as-you-go instance.

## Billing

For more information, see [Billing items and pricing](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Billing items and pricing.md).

## Procedure

After you perform the following operations, ApsaraDB for MongoDB automatically creates your instance. You do not need to manually install or deploy an instance.

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB for MongoDB console](https://mongodb.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the resource group and the region of the target instance.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Sharded Cluster Instances**.

4.  On the **Sharded Cluster Instances** page, click **Create Instance**.

5.  Click **Sharded Cluster \(Subscription\)** or **Sharded Cluster \(Pay-as-you-go\)**.

    **Note:**

    -   Subscription: You must pay for an instance when you create the instance. This method is more cost-effective than the pay-as-you-go method. We recommend that you select this method for long-term use. A longer subscription period enables a larger discount.
    -   Pay-as-you-go: You are billed on an hourly basis based on the used resources. We recommend that you select this billing method for short-term use. You can reduce costs by releasing your pay-as-you-go instance after you no longer need the instance.
6.  Configure the instance parameters. The following table describes the related parameters.

    |Section|Parameter|Description|
    |:------|:--------|:----------|
    |**Basic Configuration**|**Region**|The region where the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance is deployed. After an instance is created, you cannot change the region. Exercise caution when you select the region.

Instances in the same region \(such as an ECS instance and an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance\) can be connected with each other over an internal network. |
    |**Zone**|Select a zone from the region. Zones are geographic locations within a region. Each zone contains independent power supply and network resources. An ECS instance and an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance in the same zone can be connected over an internal network with minimum network latency. For more information about zones, see [Zones](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/40654.htm#h2-url-2).

**Note:** To implement zone-disaster recovery, you can deploy the sharded cluster instance across multiple zones. For more information, see [Create a multi-zone sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Zone-disaster restoration solution/Create a multi-zone sharded cluster instance.md). |
    |**Database Version**|The MongoDB version of the sharded cluster instance. Valid values: 3.4, 4.0, and 4.2. For more information about versions, see [MongoDB versions and storage engines](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/MongoDB versions and storage engines.md).

**Note:** You can manually upgrade the database version when an instance is running. For more information, see [Upgrade MongoDB versions](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Upgrading Database Version/Upgrade MongoDB versions.md). |
    |**Storage Engine**|The storage engine of the instance, which is fixed as **WiredTiger**. |
    |**Network Type**|**Classic**|Cloud services on a classic network are not isolated. Unauthorized access can only be blocked by using security groups or whitelists.|
    |**VPC**|A virtual private cloud \(VPC\) is an isolated network with higher security and performance than the classic network. We recommend that you select the VPC network type. **Note:**

    -   You must create a VPC in advance. For more information, see [Create a VPC](/intl.en-US/VPCs and vSwitchs/Work with VPCs.md).
    -   You can change the network type after you create an instance. For more information, see [Switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Network connection management/Switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).
    -   If you want to migrate your applications to the cloud, you can build a virtual data center by connecting your on-premises data center to the resources in a VPC through a leased line or a virtual private network \(VPN\). For more information, see [Configure a hybrid access solution to switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance from classic network to VPC](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Network connection management/Configure a hybrid access solution to switch the network type of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance from classic network to VPC.md). |
    |**Mongos Specification**|**Specification**|The specifications of each mongos node. For more information, see [Instance types](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance types.md). **Note:** You can add new mongos nodes or change the configurations of existing shard nodes while a sharded cluster instance is running. |
    |**Quantity**|The number of mongos nodes. A sharded cluster instance can contain 2 to 32 mongos nodes. |
    |**Shard Specifications**|**Specification**|The specifications of each shard node. For more information, see [Instance types](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance types.md). **Note:** You can add new shard nodes or change the configurations of existing shard nodes while a sharded cluster instance is running. |
    |**Storage Space**|The storage capacity of each shard node. Valid values: 10 GB to 1,000 GB. **Note:** The storage capacity of a shard node stores your data, system, and log files. |
    |**Quantity**|The number of shard nodes. A sharded cluster instance can contain 2 to 32 shard nodes. |
    |**Configserver Specifications**|**Specification**|The specifications of each Configserver node, which is fixed as 1 vCPU, 2 GiB memory, and 20 GB of storage capacity. The Configserver specifications are not user-configurable. |
    |**Set Password**|**Set Now**|    -   The password must contain at least three of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Special characters include

!@\#$%^&\*\(\)\_+-=

    -   The password must be 8 to 32 characters in length. |
    |**Set Later**|Set a password after the instance is created. For more information, see [Set a password for a sharded cluster instance]().|
    |**Validity**|N/A|You must specify this parameter when you create a sharded cluster instance that uses the subscription billing method. You can select one to nine months for the subscription period on a monthly basis, or one to five years for the subscription period on a yearly basis.|

7.  After you configure the preceding parameters, click **Buy Now**.

8.  On the Confirm Order page, read and select ApsaraDB for MongoDB Agreement of Service, and complete the payment.
