# Automatically renew a subscription-based instance {#task_mxj_kb2_j2b .task}

You can enable the automatic renewal of a subscription-based instance. In this case, you do not need to manually renew the instance on a regular basis. This feature also ensures that the instance can be automatically renewed to avoid business interruption.

If you did not enable automatic renewal when purchasing a subscription-based instance, you can also enable this feature in the Alibaba Cloud console. After this feature is enabled, the instance can be automatically renewed based on the selected renewal period. For example, if you select a three-month renewal period, the instance is automatically renewed and billed for another three months each time.

**Note:** When purchasing a subscription-based instance, you can select **Auto Renew** while specifying **Duration**.

-   Subscription period on a monthly basis: The automatic renewal period is a month.
-   Subscription period on a yearly basis: The automatic renewal period is a year.
