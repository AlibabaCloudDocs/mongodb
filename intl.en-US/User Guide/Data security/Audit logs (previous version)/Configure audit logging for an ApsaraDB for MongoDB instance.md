# Configure audit logging for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance

This topic describes how to configure audit logging for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance. This feature records all operations you have performed on the databases of your instance. With audit logs, you can perform operations such as fault analysis, behavior analysis, and security audit on databases.

You can use the new audit log feature. The old version has been unavailable. For more information, see [Enable the new audit log feature](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Data security/Audit logs (new version)/Enable the new audit log feature.md).
