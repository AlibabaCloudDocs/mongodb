# Enable the new audit log feature

The new audit log feature integrates the features of Log Service with ApsaraDB for MongoDB. The audit log feature allows you to filter log data, analyze logs online, and export logs. This helps you discover security and performance issues of your ApsaraDB for MongoDB instances at the earliest opportunity.

If you want to enable the new audit log feature as a RAM user, the RAM user must be granted the AliyunLogFullAccess permissions. For more information, see [Grant permissions](~~121945~~).

Alibaba Cloud Log Service is an all-in-one service and has been used in big data analytics scenarios.

ApsaraDB for MongoDB integrates the features of Log Service to provide the new audit log feature, which is characterized by stability, ease of use, flexibility, and high efficiency.

This topic describes how to enable the new audit log feature.
