# Get started

This topic describes how to get started with a replica set instance of ApsaraDB for MongoDB. In this topic, you can quickly become familiar with the operations for creating, configuring, and connecting to an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

## Flowchart for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance

The first time you use ApsaraDB for MongoDB, you can start with [Before you start](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Usage notes.md).

The following figure shows the operations that you must perform before you use an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

1.  Create a instance. The procedure depends on the instance architecture type. For more information, see the following topics:
    -   [Create a standalone instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Single-node quick start/Create a standalone instance.md)
    -   [Create a replica set instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick Start of Replica Set/Create a replica set instance.md)
    -   [Create a sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick start for sharded clusters/Create a sharded cluster instance.md)
2.  [Reset the password](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick Start of Replica Set/Reset the password.md).
3.  [Configure a whitelist for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick Start of Replica Set/Configure a whitelist for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).
4.  [Apply for a public endpoint for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick Start of Replica Set/Apply for a public endpoint for an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.md).
5.  Connect to a instance. The procedure depends on the instance architecture type. For more information, see the following topics:
