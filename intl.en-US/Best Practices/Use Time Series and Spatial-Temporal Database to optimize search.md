# Use Time Series and Spatial-Temporal Database to optimize search

This topic describes how to use Time Series and Spatial-Temporal Database to build fully managed and integrated search and analysis capabilities on ApsaraDB for MongoDB and help enterprises better manage data.

ApsaraDB for MongoDB is widely used in the Internet, gaming, and finance industries. With business growth, more and more enterprises want to search and analyze the data stored in MongoDB databases. The built-in text indexes of MongoDB only support string-type queries and have limited query capabilities. Text indexes cannot meet advanced retrieval requirements such as text splitting, fuzzy search, score sorting, highlighted results, and aggregate analysis. If data is synchronized from MongoDB to an external search system such as Solr or Elasticsearch, complex development and maintenance can be resulted.

To meet such requirements, ApsaraDB for MongoDB uses [Time Series and Spatial-Temporal Database](https://www.aliyun.com/product/apsaradb/lindorm) to provide an integrated full-text search solution to enhance its retrieval capabilities. For more information about Time Series and Spatial-Temporal Database, see [Time Series and Spatial-Temporal Database Product Overview]().
