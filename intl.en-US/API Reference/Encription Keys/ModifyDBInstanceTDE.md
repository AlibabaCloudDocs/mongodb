# ModifyDBInstanceTDE

You can call this operation to modify the transparent data encryption \(TDE\) status of an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.

TDE can be used to perform real-time I/O encryption and decryption on data files. Data is encrypted before being written to disks, and decrypted before being read from disks to the memory. For more information, see [Configure TDE](~~131048~~).

**Note:** After TDE is enabled, it cannot be disabled.

Before you call this operation, make sure that the following requirements are met:

-   A replica set or sharded cluster instance is used.
-   The storage engine of the instance is WiredTiger.
-   The database engine version of the instance is 4.0 or 4.2. If the database engine version is earlier than 4.0, you can call the [UpgradeDBInstanceEngineVersion](~~67608~~) operation to upgrade the database engine.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Dds&api=ModifyDBInstanceTDE&type=RPC&version=2015-12-01)
