# Notice on changing the monitoring data collection interval to 60 seconds as November 19, 2020

As of November 19, 2020, the collection interval of ApsaraDB for MongoDB monitoring data changes to 60 seconds.

## Background information

A collection interval indicates how often the system automatically collects resource information. In earlier versions, ApsaraDB for MongoDB supports collection intervals of 1 seconds and 300 seconds. The 1-second interval is too high a frequency and the 300-second interval is too low a frequency. Both cannot meet customer requirements. To solve this problem, Alibaba Cloud changes the collection interval of ApsaraDB for MongoDB monitoring data to 60 seconds. This allows you to find problems such as resource exceptions and fix them in a timely manner.

## Effective date

November 19, 2020

## Changes

-   The collection interval of 60 seconds becomes available.
