# Can I add nodes to an ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance?

You can add nodes to a replica set or sharded cluster instance.

**Note:** You are not allowed to add nodes to standalone instances.

-   Replica set instances

    By default, a replica set instance has three nodes. For more information, see [Change the number of nodes for a replica set instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Changing Instance Configuration/Change the number of nodes for a replica set instance.md).

-   Sharded cluster instances

    By default, a sharded cluster instance has two shards and two mongos. For more information, see [Change the configuration of a sharded cluster instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Changing Instance Configuration/Change the configuration of a sharded cluster instance.md).
