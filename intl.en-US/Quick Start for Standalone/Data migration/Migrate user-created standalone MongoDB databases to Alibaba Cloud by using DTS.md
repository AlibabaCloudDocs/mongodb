# Migrate user-created standalone MongoDB databases to Alibaba Cloud by using DTS

This topic describes how to use Data Transmission Service \(DTS\) to migrate data from standalone user-created MongoDB databases to Alibaba Cloud. DTS supports full data migration and incremental data migration.

To migrate all data without service interruption, you can select both full data migration and incremental data migration. You can also use the built-in commands of MongoDB to migrate user-created MongoDB databases. For more information, see [Migrate user-created databases to Alibaba Cloud by using tools provided by MongoDB](/intl.en-US/Quick Start for Standalone/Data migration/Migrate user-created databases to Alibaba Cloud by using tools provided by MongoDB.md).

For more information about data migration or synchronization solutions, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Data migration and synchronization/Overview.md).

## Prerequisites

-   The version of the user-created MongoDB database is 4.2, 4.0, 3.0, 3.2, or 3.4.
-   The storage space of the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance is larger than the size of the user-created MongoDB database.

## Precautions

-   To avoid service disruptions, we recommend that you migrate data during off-peak hours.
-   If the source user-created MongoDB database and the destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance run different MongoDB versions or storage engines, ensure that your applications can run on both databases. For more information about MongoDB versions and storage engines that are supported by ApsaraDB for MongoDB, see [MongoDB versions and storage engines](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/MongoDB versions and storage engines.md).
-   To migrate incremental data from a standalone user-created MongoDB database, you must enable the oplog feature for the database. For more information, see [Preparations for incremental data migration](#section_l3m_8mq_6gb).

## Billing

|Migration type|Instance configurations|Internet traffic|
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------|
|Full data migration|Free of charge.|Charged only when data is migrated from Alibaba Cloud over the Internet. For more information, see [Pricing]().|
|Incremental data migration|Charged. For more information, see [Pricing]().|

## Migration types

-   Full data migration: All historical data in the source MongoDB database is migrated to the destination MongoDB database.

    **Note:** Data migration is supported at the database, collection, and index levels.

-   Incremental data migration: After full data migration, incremental data is synchronized to the destination MongoDB database.

    **Note:**

    -   The create and delete operations for databases, collections, and indexes can be synchronized.
    -   The create, delete, and update operations for documents can also be synchronized.

## Permissions required for database accounts

|Database|Full data migration|Incremental data migration|
|:-------|:------------------|--------------------------|
|Source user-created MongoDB database|Read permissions on the source database|Read permissions on the source database, admin database, and local database|
|Destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance|Read/write permissions on the destination database|Read/write permissions on the destination database|

## Preparations for incremental data migration

Before you use DTS to migrate incremental data, enable the oplog feature for the source database. If you only perform full data migration, skip the following steps.

**Note:** This operation restarts the MongoDB database. We recommend that you perform this operation during off-peak hours.

1.  Use Mongo Shell to connect to the user-created MongoDB database.

2.  Run the following commands to shut down the MongoDB database:

    ```
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()
    ```

3.  Run the following command to start the MongoDB database in the background as a replica set:

    ```
    mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log --replSet rs0 --bind_ip 0.0.0.0 --auth --fork
    ```

    **Note:**

    -   In this command, /var/lib/mongodb is the database path, and /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log is the log file path. Specify the paths based on business needs.
    -   This command uses 0.0.0.0 as the associated IP address of the MongoDB database. This allows you to access the database by using all IP addresses. After the migration is complete, run the `kill` command to end the process, and start the MongoDB database by using the original configuration file.
    -   This command enables authentication. You can only access the database after you pass the authentication.
4.  Use Mongo Shell to reconnect to the user-created MongoDB database.

5.  Run the following commands to initialize the replica set:

    ```
    use admin
    rs.initiate()
    ```

6.  The role of the current node changes to primary.

    **Note:** You can run the `rs.printReplicationInfo()` command to view the status of oplog.

6.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Set Whitelist and Next**.

    **Note:** The CIDR blocks of DTS servers are automatically added to the whitelist of the destination RDS instance. This ensures that DTS servers can connect to the destination ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance. After the migration is completed, you can remove these CIDR blocks from the whitelist. For more information, see [Configure a whitelist for a replica set instance](/intl.en-US/Quick Start for Replica Set/Configure a whitelist for a replica set instance.md).

7.  Configure migration types and objects to be migrated.

    ![Select the migration types and objects to be migrated](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8924948951/p38327.png)

    |Parameter|Description|
    |:--------|:----------|
    |Migration Types|    -   To perform only full data migration, select **Full Data Migration**.
    -   To migrate data with minimal downtime, select both **Full Data Migration** and **Incremental Data Migration**.

**Note:**

        -   Before migrating incremental data from a standalone user-created MongoDB database, you must enable oplog for the database. For more information, see [Preparations for incremental data migration](#section_l3m_8mq_6gb).
        -   If the **Incremental Data Migration** option is not selected, do not write new data to the user-created MongoDB database when full data migration is in progress. Otherwise, data inconsistency may occur. |
    |Migration objects|    -   Select objects from the **Available** section and click the ![Right arrow](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3457359951/p40698.png) icon to move the objects to the **Selected** section.

**Note:**

        -   Data in the admin and local databases cannot be migrated.
        -   The config database is an internal database. We recommend that you do not migrate data in the config database.
    -   A migration object can be a database, collection, or function.
    -   By default, the name of an object remains unchanged after migration. You can change the names of the objects in the destination RDS instance by using the object name mapping feature. For more information, see [Object name mapping](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/26628.htm). |

8.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Precheck**.

    **Note:**

    -   Before you can start the data migration task, a precheck is performed. You can start the data migration task only after the task passes the precheck.
    -   If the task fails to pass the precheck, click the ![Info icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p50068.png) icon next to each failed item to view details. Troubleshoot the issues based on the causes and run the precheck again.
9.  After the task passes the precheck, click **Next**.

10. In the Confirm Settings dialog box, specify the **Channel Specification** parameter and select **Data Transmission Service \(Pay-As-You-Go\) Service Terms**.

11. Click **Buy and Start** to start the migration task.

    -   Full data migration

        Do not manually stop a task during full data migration. Otherwise, the system may fail to perform a full data migration. Wait until the data migration task automatically stops.

    -   Incremental data migration

        An incremental data migration task does not automatically stop. You must manually stop the migration task.

        **Note:** Select an appropriate time to manually stop the migration task. For example, you can stop the migration task during off-peak hours or before you switch your workloads to the destination instance.

        1.  Wait until **Incremental Data Migration** and **The migration task is not delayed** appear in the progress bar of the migration task. Then, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes. The delay time of **incremental data migration** may be displayed in the progress bar.
        2.  After the status of **Incremental Data Migration** changes to **The migration task is not delayed**, stop the migration task.

            ![No delay exists during incremental data migration](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7535298951/p33674.png)

12. Switch your workloads to the ApsaraDB for MongoDB instance.
